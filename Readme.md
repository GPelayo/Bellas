## Synopsis

This is a photo gallery that periodically gathers pictures from various sources. Currently, it only gathers pictures from Reddit.

## Motivation

I made this project as template for other projects. The code structure is shared from my other closed sourced projects. It also gave me a reason to learn Celery with Django.
